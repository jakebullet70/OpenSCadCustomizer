# OpenSCadCustomizer
GUI for editing OpenSCAD customizer files. This will allow you to input a few varibles and click a button and you get a custom sized box for you project. It is Free Software and released under the [GNU Affero General Public License V3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html). Supported on Windows 7 and above.  
 
## Why?  
I 3d-print allot of electronic project boxes. I Got tired of editing sizes by hand so this program was born. Yes, you can do this in OpenSCAD in the customizer but I got to the point where there my CAD files had 20 different varibles you could change but I only needed to change 3 and would forget which where the right ones to change. 

## Usage  
1. Download the latest release zip file.
2. Unzip to whatever folder you want.
3. Run the EXE and click the Setup button to setup paths.
4. One your model is generated and in your slicer if needed do a 'split parts'
