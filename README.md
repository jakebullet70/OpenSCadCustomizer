# OpenSCadCustomizer
GUI for editing OpenSCAD customizer files. This will allow you to input a few varibles and click a button and you get a custom sized box for you project. It is Free Software and released under the [GNU Affero General Public License V3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html).  
 
# Why?  
I 3d-print allot of electronic project boxes. I Got tired of editing sizes by hand so this program was born. Yes, you can do this in OpenSCAD in the cusomizer but I got to the point where there my CAD files had 20 different varibles you could change but I only needed to change 3 and would forget which where the right ones to change.
